            <p class="about_paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
            <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration
                in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you
                are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden
                in the middle of text.</p>
            <p>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
                generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
                repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
            <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
                original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.Lorem Ipsum comes
                from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                Cicero, written in 45 BC. </p>
